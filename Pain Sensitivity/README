Pain Sensitivity
(Introduction to Statistical Programming: Home Final Project)

This repository contains the final project for the Introduction to Statistical Programming course. The project focuses on analyzing a dataset from a pain-induction experiment using R for statistical programming and analysis.

Project Overview

The project explores the relationships between pain sensitivity (to both heat and pressure stimuli) and various demographic variables (such as gender, origin, and religion). Through this analysis, we apply a variety of statistical methods to uncover potential associations and interactions between these factors, with particular emphasis on gender moderation.

Key Objectives:

- Analyze pain sensitivity distribution for different types of stimuli.
- Explore the role of demographic factors in pain perception.
- Investigate whether gender moderates the relationship between pain sensitivity to heat and pressure stimuli.
- Apply logistic regression and model evaluation techniques to assess demographic influences.

Data Description

- Pain sensitivity measurements:
-- pain60heat (heat stimuli),
-- pain60press (pressure stimuli),
-- follow-up pain tests at different time points

- Demographic information: gender, origin, religion, education, employment status, and more.

- Chronic pain indicators: including a binary variable indicating whether the participant had experienced pain for at least 3 months.

Statistical methods used

- Descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset.
- Correlation analysis to investigate linear relationships between pain variables.
- Cronbach's alpha to assess internal consistency of pain measurements.
- Independent samples t-tests to compare pain sensitivity between genders.
- Moderation analysis to explore gender's influence on the pain sensitivity relationship.
- Logistic regression to model the effect of demographic variables on pain perception.

Key findings

- Pain sensitivity: No significant difference was found in pain sensitivity to heat stimuli between genders, but there was a significant negative association between gender and pain sensitivity to pressure stimuli.
- Gender moderation: Gender significantly moderates the relationship between heat and pressure pain sensitivity.
- Demographic influences: Factors like origin and religion also impact pain perception, though further model comparison is needed to refine these results.
